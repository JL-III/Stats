# Stats

## Description
keeps track of unique login counts for the day

## Reason for Creation
Although plugins like this already exist, I thought it would be fun to build one myself.

## TODO

## Roadmap
- persist data
- keep track of weekly, monthly, and yearly login counts
  - rolling year, instead of calendar year
- login streaks?
- streak rewards?
- broadcast login streaks?
- broadcast streak rewards?
